#Data Set Information
This is perhaps the best known database to be bound in the pattern recognition literature.
The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant.
One class is linearly separaly from the other 2;the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other.
The predicted attribute (the output) is the class of iris plant.

#Features Information
1.sepal length in cm
2.sepal width in cm

4.petal width in cm
5.class:
       -Iris Setosa
       -Iris Versicolour
